# rgdbg.jl
This is a julia package to be used for generating datasets/databases of graphs for general use purpose, for example in ML. The acronym stands for "Random Graph DataBase Generator". This should lead to an eventual additional package for creating DBs of random graphs that should allow for running/training anomally detection algorithms on.

# TODO:

    - Add more detailed documentation and examples.
