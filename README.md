# rgdbg.jl
This is a julia package to be used for generating datasets/databases of graphs for general use purpose, for example in ML. The acronym stands for "Random Graph DataBase Generator". This should lead to an eventual additional package for creating DBs of random graphs that should allow for running/training anomally detection algorithms on.

# TODO:

    - Add more detailed documentation and examples. '''THIS IS ESSENTIAL'''

    - Figure what the hell the schemas should be, and make everything else work with it in a nice well-synchronized 
    fashion. '''THIS IS MOSTLY SOLVED. STILL NEED TO THINK OF SCHEMA FOR ANOMALIES - WILL DECIDE ON THIS LATER.'''

    - Add important 'Base.' operations to the module to create a friendlier and more usable interface.
